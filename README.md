# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Python. The current projects focus on Lung Cancer Prediction and Titanic Survival Prediction. Each project is organized into its own folder and includes the necessary data, code, and a README file for description.

## Projects Included:

* **Lung Cancer Prediction:** This project aims to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various risk factors and patient characteristics. It utilizes machine learning classification algorithms to build a predictive model.

* **Titanic Survival Prediction:** This project tackles the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare. It explores data analysis, feature engineering, and model training to achieve this goal.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/sebin253/Machine-Learning-.git`
2. **Navigate to the desired project folder:**
   - For Lung Cancer Prediction: `cd Lung-Cancer-Prediction`
   - For Titanic Survival Prediction: `cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction`
3. **Install the necessary dependencies:** Refer to the `requirements.txt` file in each project folder. You can install the dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Run the code:** Execute the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks within each project folder to see the solution in action.

## Contributing:
